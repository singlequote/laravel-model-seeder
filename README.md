### Installation
```console
composer require singlequote/laravel-locale-finder
```

### Usage
The package searches for translations key in your blade files. For example `{{ __("My translation") }}`. Or `@lang('My Translation')`.
After searching the package will try to translate the keys using the google [translate package](https://github.com/Stichoza/google-translate-php).

> When removing translations from your view, the package will also remove the keys from the files.

The command can be used from the commandline

For example, find and translate all dutch translation keys
```console
php artisan language:find-and-add --locales=nl
```

or find and translate the dutch and german translations keys
```console
php artisan language:find-and-add --locales=nl,de
```

#### Disabling translation
If you would like to just get the keys from your views, you can use the `--notranslate` option.
This will fill the values with the default keys.

```console
php artisan language:find-and-add --locales=nl --notranslate
```
